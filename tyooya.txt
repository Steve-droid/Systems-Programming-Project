1. Map the labels to a label table.
2. Move each line in the .am file to an array of strings according to the number of arguments.
 Each cell in the array of string contains an argument.

 Each one of the pointers to int points to an array that contains each field that needs to be incoded. 
 If The field is a label, the ponter to the corresponding array cell points to the key of the label.
